# ParticleFireJs

This is a port of https://github.com/LongbowGames/ParticleFire to javascript.

You can try it here : https://ntoniazzi.github.io/ParticleFireJs/

# TODO

Some parts are still missing:
* FireWall
* multi colored fire

Some things needs to be optimized:
* burn effect is too CPU intensive
* effects and color palettes should be externalized (plugins)
